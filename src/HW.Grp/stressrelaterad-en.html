            <p>This section is all about stress and how to prevent stress-related illness. There are three primary strategies when dealing with stress management and health promotion activities. One can work:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reactive - when the problems have already occurred and is trying to repair. This option costs the most in both time and energy economically.</li>
              <li>Prevention - prevention so that problems will not occur. In the long run it costs always less to prevent than to repair when the damage is already done.</li>
              <li>Proactive - to work actively to promote a positive and healthy work environment. This is the most cost-effective and energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the help of the exercises included in this section provides practical methods to work proactively and prevention and, where appropriate reactive. Below is a guide to how to choose exercises.</p>
            <p>If you have one or more employees who are on sick leave for stress-related problems, you can do the following exercises:</p>
            <p>If you have been signs that stress may be a problem with you, you can do the following exercises:</p>
            <p>If it is about an individual:</p>
            <p>If it is about a group:</p>
            <p>
              Working with health promotion and stress may very well be something that you already do. It is often included as a part when working with the strategic development of the business and its employees. It is to have clear objectives , and describe
              how you will achieve the goals . It is also about providing relevant feedback so that employees can assess the results of their work as well as to exhibit a stand tall in confidence-building leadership .
            </p>
            <p>
              Low efficiency often leads to stress and if you want to increase the effectiveness of the group, it is a success factor to describe things in behavior. You help, for example, your employees significantly if you are specific in your communication
              and avoid vague expressions such as: "Do not be too ambitious," or "You do not have to be so careful." Expression rather clearly what you want them to do and how you want them to do it. For example: "I want to ask you to prioritize these things
              ..." or "When writing reports need not be more than five pages, and you do not describe the method every time." You can do exercises on how to promote behavior here .
