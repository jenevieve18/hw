    As a manager, you have the opportunity to influence how well the business works by increasing employees' confidence and trust in you as a manager. A and O is that what you say and what you do are linked. Employees' confidence in you is thus based
    on how you act. For example, say, "I'll check it out," it also means that you actually need to check it out - and revisit the issue. If you say, "Now we prioritize this task", it means that you do not give another, conflicting instructions
    or comments such as: "Why have not you done this second task."

    Trust Creation is also to stand up for their mistakes. To say "I was wrong" or "I should have acted differently", is thus confidence building. Similarly to stand because there are problems and conflicts, when available. Easy but difficult, therefore,
    to build trust! Want to hone your ability to create trust? Then you will find exercises for this *
