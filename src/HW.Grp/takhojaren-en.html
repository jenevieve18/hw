            <p>Time: 10-15 minutes for the boss; 1-2 hours as a group exercise. Systematic implementation point action for 2-3 months.</p>
            <p>
              In many workplaces are open climate and high ceilings something you really want to achieve. One way to get there is to be strategic and to create the conditions for transparency in the working group in a structured way. This exercise identifies an open
              climate mean for you and four simple steps that can take you there. Start by doing the exercise on your own first. Then you can carry it along with your workgroup. If you want to achieve a permanent change, implement systematically what you come up
              for 2-3 months and evaluating continuously.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Begin to reflect on what an open climate. Concretize what a climate of transparency mean for you. How do the employees and managers, and how they interact? Write down the specific behaviors that you feel is vital to have an open climate.</p>
            <p>
              <textarea id="input0" style="width:100%;height:100px" name="input0"></textarea>
            </p>
            <div class="accordion">
              <h3>Do you find it difficult to think of any relevant behaviors, you can assume proposals you find here.</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  <textarea id="input1" style="width:100%;height:100px" name="input1"></textarea>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Start where you are</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have identified what is important to have an open climate, it is time to begin a gradual change. The idea is that you start where you and your employees is by you encourage all acts reminiscent of what you want to see more of. Gradually you
              become more selective then focused on documents that are closer to "target behavior".
            </p>
            <p>Now imagine that you have entered the "feedback" as one of the most important factors to get an open climate.</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Begin to take on feedback glasses. The task now is to relate to what your employees say that embryos to constructive feedback.</li>
                <li>
                  Imagine that you have an employee who "complain". Encourage initially all that sympathetic can be interpreted as feedback. Avoid remarking on how the complaint describes, and help instead to reformulate it constructively. This way you represent a positive
                  example that could serve as a model employee. This step is often the most difficult because it is easy to be provoked by complaints that the usually does not feel constructive. It can be helpful to see this as a challenge to yourself to come up
                  with new, more effective ways to express yourself.

                    <tr>
                      <th>Coworker</th>
                      <th>Manager</th>

                <li>
                  Gradually increase "requirements" by adding questions that gives employees a chance to express themselves more constructive. Be specific and suggest solutions. The challenge is to deliver your comments in an honest way meant that there will be no sticking.
                  To be taken seriously, you need to manage to convey that you mean what you say.
                  <table>
                    <tr>
                      <th>Coworker</th>
                      <th>Manager</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td class="bubble">"The new service is <br>way too vague!"<br><br></td>
                      <td class="bubble">"Thank you focus on this <br>important issue. How<br>is it unclear? "<br><br></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td></td>
                      <td class="bubble">"Good that you bring this <br>up. What is it that you are <br>specifically thinking of? <br>How do you think we <br>could solve this? "<br><br></td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Raise the level of difficulty further by asking employees to come up with solution proposals and discuss the pros and cons. Pay attention to how the new severity is received. If you raise the requirements for fast employees will experience it as too demanding
                  and tough with motfr√•gorna. Then they can reduce its commitment in providing constructive feedback.
                  <table>
                    <tr>
                      <th>Coworker</th>

                    <tr>
                      <td class="bubble">"The new service is far too <br>vague. We've double-worked <br>several times in the past <br>week, and we do things<br>in the wrong order. "<br><br><br></td>
                      <td class="bubble">"Yes, this is indeed a problem. <br>Would we be able to jointly<br>look at possible solutions, <br>and what advantages and <br>disadvantages <br>there?<br></td>

                    <tr>
                      <td></td>

                    </tr>
                  </table>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In summary: How can you go from having problems dumped in his lap to get creative suggestions where employees are engaged from start to finish.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thanks for the comments come no matter how they are presented.</li>
              <li>Ask follow-up questions to better understand the problem.</li>
              <li>Ask what they look for possible solutions.</li>
              <li>Ask them the reason the pros cons of the various solutions and, if possible, ask them to recommend one of the solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>But you can not just tell people to give more feedback to be constructive, etc.?</h2>
            <p>
              It feels frustrating to change a (small) step at a time? Then it may be useful to consider what the alternative is. How often have you been with the example that people manage to do great and lasting changes quickly? For example it is quite unusual
              that from nothing suddenly start training hard several times a week. Now if you do, how long do such changes last?
            </p>
            <p>You can also simply encourage your employees to focus more on the behavior you want to encourage. Although it may be a good first step, it is rarely sufficient. If employees change behavior, it is essential that they also experience positive effects of the change. If you want them to do it again, it is good that they are appreciated, notice that they can influence and that their opinion be taken advantage of. Many times it is more efficient and sustainable to start where you are and then move progressively forward.</p>
            <p>For example, you want to increase the incidence of feedback of the Working Group, it is good to encourage all types of feedback to begin with, no matter how it is worded. If the feedback is vague or irrelevant, you can start by asking kindly worded follow-up questions to clarify. Then you should raise the requirements on feedback quality by gradually switching to only encourage feedback that contains any type of action proposed (constructive).</p>
