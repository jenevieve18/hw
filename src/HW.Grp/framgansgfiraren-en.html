            <p>Every success that your group provides an opportunity for you to focus on results and efforts in a positive way. Below are some questions that you can reflect on when you plan your celebration. Followed by guidelines which ensure that the celebration is truly motivating for employees.</p>

              <h3><span title="Click for more information">Why should you celebrate success?</span></h3>
              <div>
                <p>It gives your employees the opportunity to pause and reflect on where they are and what has taken them there. It will be a natural opportunity not only to enjoy but also to analyze success factors and spontaneously reinforce what worked well.</p>

              <h3><span title="Click for more information">What is appropriate to celebrate?</span></h3>
              <div>
                <p>Generally you can say that you can celebrate the results or efforts. Most often result easiest to see and pay attention. Sometimes you may also like to celebrate the efforts that they believe will lead to results in the long term. This is particularly appropriate when it goes a long time before the results come.

                  When you know what is worth celebrating is to find the right way to celebrate. The challenge is to find ways to celebrate that are perceived as relevant for your employees. Do not be fooled that "the bigger the better". Rather, there is a risk of too grandiose celebrations: namely, habituation factor. We have celebrated in a grand way once, it may become a baseline against which future celebration is compared (and then fall short). Small celebrations will also be easier to do many times, which is good for the motivating effect. For the celebration, apply the rule: "Sm�slaget, personal and so often there is a reason." <br>Finding ways to celebrate that are perceived as relevant based on your particular employee incentives is a challenge! Below are some things you can do to celebrate a success.
