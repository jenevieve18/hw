            <h2>Time: 10-20 minutes, both individual and group exercise</h2>
            <p>This exercise is designed to help you to reflect on what can protect and strengthen you in life in general, and for a change in particular. Such reflection helps you to find protective factors and increases the likelihood that you use them. During turbulent circumstances it is particularly important to prioritize recovery. Below are some simple questions that can help you do what is recovery for you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the recovery for you? Write down examples of situations where you know that you are recovering. For example: "When I listen to good music." "When I'm engrossed in a task." "When I'm in the wild." "When I spend time with a good friend."</li>
              <li>Think about how you can implement this more often in everyday life. Is there anything you can do right now - do it. Book well in some activities (suggested 1-3 pieces) in the calendar. This increases the likelihood that they get implemented.</li>
              <li>Think through your activities. Are there any challenges or obstacles that make it difficult for you to implement them in everyday life? Concretize in such cases what you can do to overcome these obstacles?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>If you want to implement this as a group exercise</h2>
            <p>Discuss these questions in groups of 2-4 persons for 10 minutes. Presenting proposals 2-5 per group facing the other. Come in large groups agree on what you can do to integrate recovery in a natural manner in everyday life.</p>
