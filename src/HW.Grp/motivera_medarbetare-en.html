      Working actively to explore ways even employees perform their jobs has proven to be a very effective way to increase their motivation and performance. There may be different explanations for this. One reason is surely that we humans simply appreciate
      the fact that when someone shows a genuine interest in what we do. Another reason may be that when examining how someone performing a task as it often leads to a meaningful conversation about work. That conversation can bring new perspectives and
      ideas, and it's also a good situation for both positive and corrective feedback. Another explanation could be that employees who feel that their manager is interested in what they are doing increasingly talk about problems they have so that they can
      get the support they need.
