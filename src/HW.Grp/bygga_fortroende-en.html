            <h2>Building trust and confidence</h2>
            <p>Confidence and trust are essential in the relationship between managers and employees and is something that you can create through their actions. It's about being predictable and to create a common thread between what you say and do. In this exercise, you can train your skills to create trust. The exercise is based on the example of the things that people do and the task is to piece together the "activator" that gets the employee to start the action with the consequence that allowed them to continue. As a bonus, the more confidence you as a manager.</p>
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            <p>Looking at the example below. If you want employees to express their opinion at a meeting, what can you do to encourage it? Choose from the list below and place the activators for the behavior and the favorable impact so that it creates a thread between: activator - the employee's behavior - favorable impact.</p>

              <tr>
                <th width="33%">Triggers </th>
                <th width="33%">The employee behavior</th>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>What if you are asking employees to say something but then do not comment on it, or say the opposite?</p>
            <p>Tip!</p>
            <p>It happens that one says "I want you to commit yourself and say what you think" when you do not really have time for discussion. It might not be there any real opportunities to influence or it may just be prepared for the positive comments. Reflect for a moment on your own before asking for opinions. In this way, you ensure that your employees know that their views really are in demand those times you ask for opinions. They will also understand that they are welcome, even if their ideas are not consistent with your views.</p>
            <h2>Example 2</h2>
            <table width="100%" cellpadding="3">
              <tr>
                <th width="33%">Triggers </th>
                <th width="33%">The employee behavior</th>
                <th width="33%">Beneficial impact</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td valign="top" style="background-color:#72bae4">
                  <div id="trigger2" style="min-height:30px" class="input3 ui-helper-reset"></div>
                </td>
                <td class="text-center">Adding their regular duties aside and prioritize something new</td>
                <td valign="top" style="background-color:#72bae4">
                  <div id="impact2" style="min-height:30px" class="input4 ui-helper-reset"></div>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p class="text-center"><a id="btn-notify2" class="ui-button ui-widget ui-corner-all">Notify</a><a id="btn-reset2" class="ui-button ui-widget ui-corner-all">Start over</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <ul id="gallery2" style="background-color:#EBEBEB" class="input5 gallery ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix"></ul>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>What if you are asking employees to prioritize something, but then forget to talk about it when you follow up the regular work?</p>
            <p>Tips!</p>
            <p>It happens that one says: "This is a priority", without having thought through the activities that consequently down-prioritized. Reflect for a moment on your own before you make a priority in your group. In this way, you ensure that you are also prepared for other lower priority. This means that your employees will trust that you will understand that other things become less priority when you ask them to prioritize something.</p>
