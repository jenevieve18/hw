  <h2>Time: 40-60 minutes.</h2>
  <p>Audience: HR process leader for executive groups (10-20 managers).</p>
  <p>
    The following exercise is carried out in connection with cutbacks, tentatively led by HR. The aim is to raise awareness among managers about the choices, feelings and ethical issues they may be facing. Through increased understanding of the consequences
    (eg, reactions and emotions) of the different roles so managers can better prepare for cutbacks. As facilitator leads you exercise and the subsequent discussions and helps participants to discuss experiences.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by dividing the heads of the three groups.</li>
    <li>
      Tell managers that they are now a family and the parents in the family gathers his children to tell them that the family has financial problems. They now no longer afford to buy food for everyone in the family and that they therefore need
      to give away some of the children.
    </li>
    <li>It is now time to hand out roles. One group consists of parents, the second of the children who remain in the family, and the third consists of those who are being left out.</li>
    <li>Each group gets over about 10 minutes to sit and discuss how it feels to be part of the group they are in.</li>
    <li>Then each group tell the others how it feels to be in that group.</li>
    <li>After each group has reported, you can have a joint discussion about how best to support each group. Switch from a family perspective to a workgroup or organisationsperspektiv.Nedan are examples of what you might think of when discussing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    NOTE! This exercise can arouse strong reactions of some participants. It is therefore important to be vigilant and take care of these participants' reactions. There is a drawback to exercise that needs to be discussed with the participants after
    the exercise has been completed. Family The example means that it can be difficult to get the perspective that some people might perceive it as something positive to leave a job. In reality, there may be individuals who will be relieved and
    happy that they are able to for a fresh start in life and devote himself to other things they would rather wish. The reaction is difficult to translate into family example.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a group is difficult to reflect and problematize, eg only conclude that it feels good to be left in the organization, you as facilitator to enable people in the other of the groups. You can also ask a few follow-up questions to stimulate more
    perspective.
  </p>
  <p>Tips to paragraph 6 of exercise that you can take up when discussing how to support each group:</p>
  <h2>The receiving end</h2>
  <p>
    <h3>Show empathy</h3>
    <p></p>Listen to the employee's reactions and allow the person to have their feelings. You can also try to reflect the feeling that the person or conveys what the person himself describes as tough. For example: "It sounds tough. I understand
    that you are concerned about your finances. "(If that is what the person is talking about)
    <h3>Help to get further</h3>
    <p></p>example:" I'm worried about you and the extent that it will go well for you. You may conclude is very sad and I know that those who are actively working to move forward doing better. I've noticed that you often talk about how hard
    it is but rarely talk about how you can move forward or what you want to do about your situation. Can we discuss how I can help you become more active? "Ask about the other person wants to discuss situationen.TÃ¤nk on how you treat the
    ending will also affect those who are allowed to stay.
  </p>
  <h2>Those who are allowed to stay</h2>
  <p>
    Show empathy to it can be difficult to remain. Employees can feel both guilt and concern about the workload of those who remain because there are fewer people who perform the tasks. The feeling will not go over, but the employees will feel that you understand,
    and then you have a greater opportunity to talk about the practical.
  </p>
  <p> Help with how to handle different duties. How can such a priority to get a manageable work situation if a group is smaller but still have the same jobs?</p>
  <p>
     How do you treat those who may conclude will also affect the commitment of those who are allowed to stay. If they witness that handles the receiving end in a bad way, it will affect their perception of the organization / you as
                    a manager. A part of this is that they can easily imagine that the next time it will "hit me".
  </p>
  <h2>The group as a whole, including both those who will stay and who will end.</h2>
  <p>Tell a meeting of what is certain, and that some will end. Say something about yourself what you feel about it that shows that you see that it is a difficult situation. You can offer the opportunity to ask questions or get to you if you have any questions.</p>
  <h2>Those who have to leave the announcement of who gets to stay or quit.</h2>
  <p>
    Discuss how to get support as a manager in the process, for example, in a network of other managers in the same situation. To lead a team in a run-down is a difficult task. However, one should not seek support for the heavy task in the employee
    group, but among other managerial colleagues or their supervisor. Consider also what you can do as an individual to cope with the task. (Balance work / leisure, work pace at work, etc.)
