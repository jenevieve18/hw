    Trust is created through that there is a common thread between what one says and what one does. For example; if you say "It is important to follow our work processes," you also need to follow up and make it easier for employees to follow these processes.
    This exercise will help you develop your skills in building trust and perceived as upright.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about what you are keen for employees to do (behavior). Then describe what you can say to start the behavior of employees (activator) and what you can do (consequence) to increase the probability that they are doing so again. Look back and see
    that you created a thread, so that you ask your employees if also followed by positive consequences. With such actions are perceived, you usually both upright and confidence-building!
