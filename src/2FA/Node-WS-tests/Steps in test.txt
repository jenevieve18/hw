Create a new user, log in as that user, check that 2FA is disabled, enable 2FA, check that your token is now invalid

Log in again, store the secret, submit the secret, check that you get a token, check that the token is valid, check that 2FA is enabled

left:
try to disable 2FA, check that it behaves as it should. (make sure that secrets are deleted so that no extra ones stay when we re-enable 2FA)
We would need to test password resets, but that would require an email account. I would have to look into that, and it'd almost be easier to do manually.
